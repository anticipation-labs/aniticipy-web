// anticipyfellowship.com, its own Vercel project, and a CATCH-ALL rewrite to
// this same backend — so adding a /fellows/* route needs no change in this
// file any more. What is left below is HQ (which deliberately stays on
// anticipy.ai, behind the site passcode) and /r/*.
// CUTOVER 2026-09-04: the default backend is now the Cloudflare Worker
// (D1-backed), which replaces the Railway PocketBase for HQ. Every /internal/*
// route rewritten below was probed on it and answers — 33/33 present, zero 404
// at the edge. Rollback is one line and needs NO code change: set the env var
// back to the Railway host —
//   FELLOWSHIP_ORIGIN=https://backend-production-61e0a.up.railway.app
// The prerequisite that makes this safe (already done): ANTICIPY_AUTH_SECRET on
// the Worker equals PocketBase's owners.authToken.secret, or every existing HQ
// session token is rejected. See, in the Anticipy backend repo,
// research/2026-09-04-the-auth-secret-nobody-set.md.
// TODO before this is the PERMANENT prod origin: give the Worker a custom domain
// (e.g. api.anticipy.ai) and put it here instead of the workers.dev hostname.
